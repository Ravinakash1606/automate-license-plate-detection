## 🔍 Introduction

This project implements an *Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)* system using Python, OpenCV, and OCR technologies. It can detect license plates from images or video, extract the text, and display or store the results for further use.

---

## ⚙ Usage

### ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* OpenCV
* EasyOCR or Tesseract
* NumPy
* Matplotlib (for visualization)

Install dependencies:

bash
pip install opencv-python easyocr numpy matplotlib


### ▶ Run the code

For image input:

bash
python alpr.py --image path/to/image.jpg


For video or webcam input:

bash
python alpr.py --video path/to/video.mp4
# or
python alpr.py --webcam


---

## 🧠 Code Description

### alpr.py

* Main script for running the ALPR pipeline.
* Accepts command-line arguments for image/video/webcam input.

### plate_detection.py

* Contains logic to detect license plates using OpenCV (contours, edge detection).

### ocr_reader.py

* Uses EasyOCR or Tesseract to recognize characters from cropped license plate regions.

### utils.py

* Utility functions for drawing boxes, formatting text, and logging.

---

## 🔄 Working

1. *Image Acquisition*: Load an image or stream from video/webcam.
2. *Plate Detection*: Locate potential license plate regions using image processing (OpenCV).
3. *Character Segmentation*: Prepare the detected plate region for OCR.
4. *OCR*: Extract alphanumeric characters using EasyOCR or Tesseract.
5. *Display/Output*: Show recognized plates on-screen or save to file/database.

---

## 🌍 Use Cases

* 🚔 *Law Enforcement*: Track stolen or suspicious vehicles in real time.
* 🚗 *Smart Parking Systems*: Automate entry/exit and billing based on plate numbers.
* 🚦 *Traffic Monitoring*: Log vehicle data at tolls or signals.
* 🏢 *Access Control*: Grant or deny entry based on authorized plate numbers.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

This ALPR project provides a foundational solution for recognizing license plates using open-source tools. It can be extended to support real-time detection, database integration, cloud APIs, or edge computing devices for deployment in smart cities and surveillance systems.
